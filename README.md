# Simple Piano

## Overview

The Simple Piano project is a web application that allows users to play piano notes using both mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. It provides a visually appealing piano interface and corresponding audio feedback for each note played.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web application presents a simple and intuitive piano layout, making it easy for users to interact with the virtual piano keys.

- **Mouse Click Interaction:** Users can play piano notes by clicking on the individual keys on the web interface.

- **Visual Feedback:** When a key is pressed, it becomes visually highlighted, providing feedback to the user. The note being played is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web page and the piano keys are defined using HTML.
